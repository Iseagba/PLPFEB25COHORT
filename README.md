#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Q1.  Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry

ANSWER
Software engineering is a branch of computer science that adopts the principle of engineering to create softwares that meets human needs.
Its importance in the technology industry cannot be over emphasized as it has it has form the standard a software must meet to be certified which includes
ensuring quality, efficiency, and meeting the complex needs of modern technology businesses across various sectors, from web applications to mobile apps and enterprise systems.

Q2.  Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  

ANSWER
They are
1. Mastering complexity
2. Mastering process
3. Mastering machine



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Q1   Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 
 ANSWER
 Prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
Its importance includes:
1. Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt.
2. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language modelsâ€™ training data.
3. Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
4. Developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models.
5. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.

Q2.  Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
